    "This app forecasts energy consumption based on exogenous variables using a SARIMAX model incorporating temperature and occupancy as exogenous variables. Users can upload their own exogenous data, and the app generates precise consumption forecasts over the specified period. Leveraging time series analysis and external factors, the model captures seasonal patterns and trends to provide reliable energy consumption predictions, supporting better planning and decision-making."

  - **Temperature:**  
    Ambient temperature readings, which affect heating/cooling energy demands.

  - **Occupancy:**  
    Number of occupants present, directly impacting energy usage through lighting, appliance use, and HVAC load.

These features are critical drivers of energy consumption in buildings. For instance, high occupancy during hot weather typically increases air conditioning use.
